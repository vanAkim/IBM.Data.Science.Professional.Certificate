# Content

This repository holds almost every files to complete the 9 courses [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) from IBM on Coursera platform.  
The ones missing are hosted in the IBM Watson service, when requested from professors. Unless specific files are set up, IBM Watson platform is private. 

---

This readme file is intended to be a portal for the key files / projects. 
However, most topics are formed as jupyter notebooks pre-constructed by professors and completed by the student, with embedded exercises, even for the course final project. In that scenario, from courses 1 to 8 they're not such interesting files to share to outsiders, except a few.  

Nonetheless, for the dedicated people, each jupyter notebook can be nicely rendered with [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), even if Github do a pretty good job to display jupyter notebooks.
